Let’s start with the ‘why’.

Over time, the original Agent Assist started showing signs of strain — not because it was poorly designed, but because our needs evolved.

A few key pain points began emerging:

The control sizing, while modern, became too bulky for the level of detail we need to display — creating a bottleneck in usable space.

The layout wasn’t fully responsive — which caused overlaps and display issues across devices and resolutions.

Theme support was minimal — making it hard to adopt dark mode or meet accessibility standards.

There was duplication of content — such as summary views and detail pages repeating the same data.

Dependency freshness was around 55%, making updates, onboarding, and integrations more difficult.

Integrating workflows like KB automation wasn’t smooth due to architectural constraints.

And finally, the app wasn’t truly asynchronous. Simple actions like searching a user would freeze the screen until all dependencies loaded — which negatively impacted the experience.”





“Now, let’s take a quick look at the new Agent Assist.
As I walk through this, keep an eye out for the docked layout, improved responsiveness, and the new ways we’re surfacing actions and navigation options.





Let’s break down what’s new in this version:

🔹 Docking Capabilities – With Igx Dock Manager, users can arrange their workspace to match their workflow — whether it’s split panes, tabs, or floating windows.

🔹 Flexible Tables – Powered by AG Grid, tables now support sorting, filtering, pagination, exports, and much more — all built for performance and clarity.

🔹 Themes Beyond Light and Dark – Thanks to DaisyUI’s latest version, users can pick from a rich set of themes or tailor their own for accessibility and preference.

🔹 Smart Context Menus – Right-click actions on table rows let agents quickly remove assistance, export data, and more — without navigating away.

🔹 Contextual Navigation – Click behavior is now field-aware. For example, clicking a User ID in GMC opens that profile in GMC; clicking the user’s photo might open their record in N-Slash. The app understands where you are and what you want to do.”







This release lays the foundation for a lot more.

🔸 ServiceNow Ticket Handling – We’re integrating ticket workflows directly into the app — reducing context switching and improving response time.

🔸 Workflow Integrations – We’re building native support for KB and automation pipelines, making it easier to embed and track operational tasks.

🔸 Brain & MBrain Integrations – With APIs coming online, we’ll soon begin surfacing contextual intelligence and automation suggestions directly in the interface.

🔸 Personalization – Agents will soon be able to save layouts, color schemes, and workspace configurations — making the tool feel personal, efficient, and consistent between sessions.






To sum it up — Agent Assist 2.0 isn’t a redesign for design’s sake.
It’s a response to real needs, shaped by experience, and built for growth.

Thank you again for your time — I’m happy to take questions or feedback now.”
